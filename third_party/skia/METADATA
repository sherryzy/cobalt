description:
  "Skia is an open-source graphics library for drawing, geometries, and "
  "images, with both hardware and software support. Cobalt most recently "
  "updated its version of Skia from m61 to m79 because many changes took place "
  "in between those two releases, and bringing in those changes will make it "
  "easier to update the Skia porting layer again in the future."
